## Getting started

First, we will need to install dependencies of our project. Open a terminal and type:

```js
yarn
```

After it has finished downloading and installing packages, run this command to start the website:

```js
yarn start
```

Now it should automatically go to the browser and open `http://localhost:3000`. If it does not, go to browser and open the link yourself.

Now you should see your website running.

Make changes and save the file, if you have any errors, fix them and check the website in the above address.

## Material

If you have any problems with `Material UI`, go to their website annd check check out how they use the components.
